"Note: Jurisdiction refers to the legal authority of state or federal correctional officials over a prisoner regardless of where the prisoner is held. State methods of enumeration may change over time. Consult the state notes for particular years to ensure parity between years and jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2001, sentenced felons from the District of Columbia are the responsibility of the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Totals may include imputed counts for jurisdictions that did not submit data in individual years. Consult individual years' Prisoners in YYYY reports for year-specific information.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
